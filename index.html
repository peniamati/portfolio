    <p>Programming student with front end and back end knowledge. I am eager to collaborate in team work 
      and to be able to meet deadlines and achieve good results. I plan to work for a company that supports 
      the professional development of its employees. I am willing to keep training myself permanently in 
      new programming knowledges or topics of interest that will allow me to grow both personally as well as 
      benefiting the performance of the company I work for.
