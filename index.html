          Programming student with front end and back end knowledge. I am eager to
          collaborate in team work and to be able to meet deadlines and achieve
          good results. I plan to work for a company that supports the
          professional development of its employees. I am willing to keep training
          myself permanently in new programming knowledges or topics of interest
          that will allow me to grow both personally as well as benefiting the
          performance of the company I work for.
